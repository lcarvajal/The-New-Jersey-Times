# The New Jersey Times

I'm using React to create The New Jersey Times, a newspaper website definitely not based on [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com).

## Tools
- HTML / CSS
- React
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev)

## Set up 
1.  `npm start`

## Current status

We have a fancy looking header!

## Roadmap

- Build menu dropdowns for header
- Update stock ticker in realtime
- Support different languages
- Article layout
- Populate article layout with some random news articles for the day
